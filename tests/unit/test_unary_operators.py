"""Unary operators must survive to the IR (pssparser D5 -- fixed).

They used not to. `!x` reached pssc as `x`, and so did `-x` and `~x`: the
parser's `visitExpression` built the operand of a unary expression and then
constructed nothing, so the operator was discarded with no diagnostic at any
severity. See `docs/pssparser-defects-2026-08-02.md`, D5.

This was the most damaging defect in the toolchain, because the output is not
wrong-looking -- it is *inverted*. Five operations in the WB DMA operation model
are guarded by `!`, and their generated SV compiled, linted clean, and did the
opposite of what the model says.

Each test asserts the *operator*, not just the presence of an `ExprUnary`.
Behind D5 sat a second defect that only a node-shape assertion would miss:
`_map_unaryop` assumed the ordinals `0=!  1=-  2=+  3=~` while the parser's
`ExprUnaryOp` declares `Plus, Minus, LogNot, BitNeg, ...`, so `!` and `+` were
transposed. That bug was unreachable while D5 hid it, and would have shipped
the same inversion by another route the moment D5 was fixed.
