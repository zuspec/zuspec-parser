"""Which `solve function` is the constructor (design §3D).

The generator folds the root's constructor into the generated class: its
arguments become the factory's arguments and its first argument is the base
address the register model is built against. Recognition was hard-coded to the
name `ctor`.

A model whose constructor is called `init` -- the PSS coding guidelines' name,
written `\\init` because `init` is reserved -- had it classified as an ordinary
export function instead. The generated class then read

    m_regs = new(this, base);

with no `base` in scope: output that looks right and does not compile. That is
the failure mode this file exists to prevent, so the tests assert the *kind*,
not that generation succeeded.
