"""Phase 3 (P3.T6): discovery against a really-installed plugin.

`test_target_discovery.py` injects entry points, which proves the policy but
never touches `importlib.metadata`, a `.dist-info`, or packaging. Those are
where a discovery mechanism actually breaks -- the group name is subtly wrong,
the object reference does not resolve, the metadata is present but the module
is not importable -- and none of it shows up against a fake.

The plugin is installed into a session-scoped temp directory, never into the
developer's environment: a test suite that mutates the environment it runs in
is a test suite people stop running. Marked ``plugin``, and skipped rather than
failed when no installer is available, so a constrained environment loses this
file and nothing else.
