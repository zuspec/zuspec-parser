"""The extension guide's examples must be real code from this repository.

Exit criterion 6 of the extension work: "`docs/custom-generator-styles.md`
covers all four levels, and every example in it is executed by a test". This is
what enforces the second half. An extension guide whose examples are not run
rots within two releases, and a rotted extension guide is worse than none -- it
costs the reader a day before they conclude the docs are wrong, and by then they
have stopped believing the parts that were still true.

The mechanism is deliberately dumb: a fenced block whose first line is a `#`
comment naming a repository file must appear VERBATIM in that file. No
extraction DSL, no doctest runner, no execution of the doc itself -- the code
runs because the file it was quoted from is on a test path, which is a much
stronger guarantee than a snippet that merely imports cleanly.

Blocks with no such header are prose illustrations. They are still checked, but
only for the things that can be checked without a source of truth: that a
`--flag` they name exists, and that a file they link to does.
