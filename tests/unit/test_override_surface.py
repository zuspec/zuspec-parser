"""P6b.T1/T2: the published override surface.

Every public method of a Python class is overridable, which is the problem
rather than the feature. These tests hold two things:

  * the MARKED set and the checked-in manifest agree, so growing the surface is
    a reviewable diff in two files instead of a decorator somebody added;
  * a subclass cannot take one half of a paired override, which is the
    mechanical part of the fragile-base-class risk (design I13).
