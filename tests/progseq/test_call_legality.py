"""The call-legality registry: the tier contract, and the manifest's honesty.

Two tests here carry the design rather than a behaviour:

  * `test_every_target_renders_the_common_set` is the Tier 1 contract. Without
    it "COMMON" is an aspiration each backend independently fails to meet --
    which was the state that produced four disagreeing copies of the builtin
    list (docs §3.0).

  * `test_manifest_matches_the_front_end_stdlib` is the check that keeps the
    Python manifest from drifting from the language. Tier 0 SHOULD be derived
    from the front end's declarations rather than restated here; it is not,
    because the declarations do not survive into the IR -- `type_map` carries
    `addr_reg_pkg::reg_group_c` with an EMPTY `functions` list, and package-scope
    functions like `print`/`read32` are not represented at all. Until ast2ir
    retains them (docs §10, item 8), a cross-check against the stdlib SOURCE is
    what makes the restatement safe: drift fails here instead of shipping.
