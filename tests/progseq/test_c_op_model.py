"""The real operation model, generated end to end as a C driver.

The C counterpart of `test_op_model_sv.py`, and the gate on C1: the projection
of a component TREE, not of a single component. Before C1 this target emitted
the root alone -- for WB DMA that is four engine-global operations and none of
the thirteen per-channel ones, in a header that compiled cleanly and contained
nothing anybody wanted. `has_not=` assertions carry that weight throughout: an
absent sub-component struct, an absent accessor and an absent operation all look
exactly like ordinary generated code.

The compile at the bottom is the cheapest strong signal available. It does not
prove the driver is right; it proves the output is C, which every structural
assertion above quietly assumes. `test_build_wb_dma_c.py` is the one that runs
the result against a mock bus and checks the register trace.
