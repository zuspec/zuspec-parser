"""Phase 7 (P7.T1): the language-neutral body walk, before anything moves.

The plan calls Phase 7 its highest-risk refactor, and the reason is that the
three body emitters produce artifacts a customer compiles. So this file proves
the shared pieces are equivalent to what the emitters compute for themselves
BEFORE either backend is asked to use them -- on the real WB DMA model, every
operation, not on a construct sample.

If the scans here disagreed with the C emitter's, the port would produce C that
still compiles and quietly stops silencing an unused local, or widens the wrong
declaration. Neither is visible in a diff of one construct.
