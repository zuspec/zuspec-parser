"""C4.1 -- `import target/solve function` reaches C under its own PSS name.

The property this file exists to hold: **adding a platform hook is a model edit,
not a generator edit.** Before C4.1 the C backend knew exactly one set of
callable names -- the `pssc_mem_*` table and a handful of built-ins -- so a model
that declared `import target function void plat_delay_us(int)` and called it
failed generation with "no lowering", and the fix was to edit the generator.

That is right for the MEMORY SEAM, which is fixed and identical for every model,
and wrong for an import, which is by definition whatever this model declared.
