"""PSS comments reaching the generated SystemVerilog and C.

The operation model is a close transcription of its PSS source, so the prose
belongs in the output at the same points -- it is the part a reader cannot
recover from the code. See docs/pss-comment-propagation-plan.md in fw-wb-dma.

Two things are asserted throughout, and the second matters more than the first:

1. A comment appears, at the right place.
2. ``--no-comments`` reproduces the pre-comment output **byte for byte**. That
   is what makes "only comments moved" a measured claim. Every emitter change
   here is guarded by it.
