"""Can a BUILT-IN variant be written the way an extension author would write it?

P6b published an override surface and validated it against
`tests/plugins/pssc_fixture_plugin`, which is an outside extension. P8.T3 asks
the harder version of the same question: is the surface sufficient to express
something pssc already ships as a FLAG -- and would expressing it that way
leave less machinery behind than it replaces?

Two variants are tried here, one per answer:

* **`--emit-stubs` CAN be a subclass.** `emit_extra_files` is exactly the right
  hook, the subclass is six lines, and its output is byte-identical to the flag's.
* **`--lifecycle static` CANNOT**, and this file measures why rather than
  asserting it: the choice is read at five places across two modules, and the
  nearest published overrides (`emit_decls`, `emit_impl`) are whole-section, so
  a subclass would have to re-derive every prototype in the API to remove two.

The second is the finding P8.T3 exists to produce -- see the plan's own accept
line: "If a built-in variant cannot be expressed this way, that is evidence the
override surface is wrong." NEITHER flag is deleted, and the reason is in the
plan's G8 note: `--emit-stubs` composes with every other option, so promoting
it to a target name trades one boolean for a combinatorial namespace.

Plan: P8.T3.
