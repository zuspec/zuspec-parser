"""C5.1 -- the behavioural gate for the COMPONENT TREE driver.

`test_build_wb_dma_c.py` gates the FLAT example model. It cannot gate this one,
and the reason is the whole point of C1: the flat model has a single register
bank, so nothing in it can tell a correct per-channel offset from a zero one.
The tree has an engine-global block plus four channel banks at
``base + 0x20 + 0x20*i``, folded at generation time from the tree walk, and that
arithmetic is exercised by nothing else in the suite.

So the assertion here is a register ACCESS TRACE, not an exit code. Every
structural test in `test_c_op_model.py` says the generated text looks right;
this is the only one that says the driver talks to the right registers, in the
right order, with the right values.

**The gate was mutation-checked.** Rewriting the generated
``(0x20u + 0x20u * i)`` to ``(0x20u)`` -- every channel pointing at bank 0 --
produces 14 failures here, including "channel banks overlap" and "the
per-channel base is not being applied". A gate that passes is only evidence if
you know what makes it fail.
