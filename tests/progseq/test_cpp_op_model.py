"""The real operation model, generated end to end as a C++ driver.

The C++ counterpart of `test_c_op_model.py`, and the gate on the thing that was
missing until 2026-08-14: this backend could not generate the real model at all.
It handled the ROOT component only, had no enum in its type mapper, no
`foreach`/`match`/`break`/`yield`, no channel runtime and no way to reach a
memory primitive -- so the one model anyone actually cares about failed with
"unsupported C++ type for DataTypeEnum" three statements in.

`has_not=` assertions carry real weight here. An absent sub-component class, an
absent operation and an absent register access all look exactly like ordinary
generated code.

The compile at the bottom is the cheapest strong signal available: it does not
prove the driver is right, it proves the output is C++, which every structural
assertion above quietly assumes. `test_op_model_behaviour_cpp.py` is the one
that runs the result against a mock bus and compares its register trace with
the C driver's.
