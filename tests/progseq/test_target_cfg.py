"""`target_cfg_pkg` -- the PSS prelude a target injects ahead of the sources.

Three layers, tested separately because they fail differently:

  * the renderer (does the emitted package say what the target claims),
  * `Target.prelude` (does the right target inject, and does `--target-cfg`
    override it),
  * end to end (does a `compile if` in a model actually see it, and does the
    generated output change).

The end-to-end pair is the load-bearing one. The others would all still pass if
the prelude were appended after the sources instead of prepended, which is the
one mistake that is silent in PSS: `compile if` reads constants only from
previously-processed source units (3.1 §19.1.2), so a late prelude does not
error -- the model simply takes its default branch.
