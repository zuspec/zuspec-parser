/* op_model_tb.c -- C5.1: the behavioural gate for the COMPONENT TREE driver.
 *
 * Drives the generated wb_dma_c API against op_model_mock and asserts a
 * register ACCESS TRACE. What that buys over the existing flat-model gate:
 *
 *   * PER-CHANNEL ADDRESS ARITHMETIC. The tree puts channel i's bank at
 *     base + 0x20 + 0x20*i, folded at generation time from the tree walk. The
 *     flat model has one bank, so nothing there can tell a correct offset from
 *     a zero one. Every assertion below names a channel other than 0.
 *   * THE WAIT LOOP ACTUALLY ITERATES. The mock reports DONE only after
 *     OM_PENDING_POLLS reads, so an operation model whose loop never runs is
 *     visible as a count, not as a hang.
 *   * THE ABORT PATH. stop_channel is the one operation that claims no
 *     `inflight` token and whose result is an ERROR rather than a clean stop.
 *
 * Prints WB_DMA OP MODEL PASS on success; on failure prints the failing check
 * AND the whole trace, because a wrong offset is unreadable without it.
