/* op_model_mock.h -- a WB DMA mock with the register semantics the OPERATION
 * MODEL actually depends on, plus an access trace.
 *
 * Distinct from dma_mock.h, which serves the FLAT example model
 * (`examples/export/programming_seqs`). That mock cannot gate the component
 * tree, because the flat model has one register bank and the tree has five: an
 * engine-global block plus four per-channel banks at base + 0x20 + 0x20*i. The
 * per-channel base arithmetic is generated from the tree walk and is exercised
 * by nothing else, so a mock that answers every address identically would let a
 * driver that programmed channel 0 four times pass.
 *
 * Hence the TRACE. `exit(0)` proves the driver ran; the trace proves it talked
 * to the right registers, in the right order, with the right values -- which is
 * the only thing that distinguishes a working driver from one whose offsets are
 * all zero.
 *
 * WHAT IS MODELLED (§3.2 of the operation model, and no more):
 *
 *   * CHn_CSR.ch_en written 1 -> the channel becomes busy, and completes after
 *     PENDING_POLLS subsequent reads of that channel's CSR. Not instantly:
 *     an operation model whose wait loop never iterates has not been tested.
 *   * CHn_CSR.stop written 1 -> err=1, busy=0. An abort is reported as an
 *     ERROR, not as a clean stop -- the device's behaviour, carried into the
 *     contract verbatim.
 *   * Reading CHn_CSR CLEARS done/err and the interrupt source bits. This is
 *     the read-to-clear the model warns about at length, and modelling it is
 *     what makes "who consumes the completion" observable at all.
 *   * Every other register is plain storage.
