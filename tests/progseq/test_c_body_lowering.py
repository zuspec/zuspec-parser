"""The C body emitter, construct by construct.

One test per PSS construct the emitter has to translate, each asserting the
emitted text AND compiling it. The two catch different things: the text
assertion catches a translation that is wrong, the compile catches one that is
merely unrepresentable. Neither catches the third kind -- a translation that
compiles and means something else -- which is why `test_build_wb_dma_c.py`
drives the result against a mock and checks the register trace.

ASSERTIONS COME IN PAIRS wherever the defect had plausible-looking output. That
is not a style preference here; it is the shape of this emitter's failures. The
one defect no compiler can see (C0.1, `self.caps` -> bare `caps`) produces C
that compiles wherever any `caps` is in scope, so `has_not=` is the only
structural signal there is.
