"""Field-named register writes in the SV backend.

`reg_rmw` folds every field-wise write to a constant (mask, value) pair, and no
field name survives into the IR -- `test_reg_ir_equivalence.py` asserts exactly
that, and it stays true. The SV emitter restores the name on the way out by
asking the register model which field has those bits, so that

    regs.csr.write_field("ars", enable)          -- PSS

reaches SystemVerilog as

    m_regs.csr.write_field(WB_DMA_CSR_ars, 32'(enable))

rather than as `write_val_masked(64, (32'(enable) & 1) << 6)`.

Three separate things have to hold, and each is checked against something that
is not the code under test:

1. **The constants are right.** Bit positions are transcribed by hand from
   `wb_dma_ch_regs_c.pss` below, not recomputed from the layout code, so a
   layout bug cannot agree with itself.
2. **The rewrite is faithful.** `--sv-reg-fields=folded` emits what this target
   emitted before any of this existed; the named form must denote the same
   write. The IR is asserted byte-identical across the two, which is what makes
   "spelling only" a measured claim rather than an intention.
3. **The emitted SV computes what it says.** A simulation drives the REAL
   generated `pssc_reg_pkg.sv` and the REAL generated constants against a stub
   bus and checks the resulting register value. Structural assertions on
   generated text have missed this class of bug before (see the operand-
   bracketing defect in `docs/reg-masked-access-status.md` §5).
