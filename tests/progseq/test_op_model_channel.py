"""``sync_pkg::channel_c<Te, DEPTH>`` -- IR translation and SV projection.

A channel is the one core-library type whose implementation belongs to the
RUNTIME rather than to the generated model, and every defect in getting there
looked like ordinary generated code:

  * the specialization reached the IR as a plain ``DataTypeComponent``, so its
    element type and depth -- the whole content of ``channel_c<bit,1>`` -- were
    gone by the time a backend saw it;
  * the backend then lowered it as a user component, emitting
    ``interface class channel_c_if; endclass`` and a ``class channel_c`` with a
    constructor and no methods. That names every type the model mentions and
    fails only at the first ``get``.

So the absence assertions below are load-bearing, not decoration: `has_not` is
what distinguishes "the channel came from the runtime" from "the channel was
generated, empty".
