"""Phase 5a: the memory-access funnel.

The golden snapshots already prove the funnel emits today's output -- they are
byte-identical across this whole phase. What they cannot do is say WHICH string
came from where, so a later refactor that moves a rendering back out of the
funnel passes them. These tests pin each rendering to the funnel itself, at the
method, so that question has an answer that does not depend on running a
generator.
