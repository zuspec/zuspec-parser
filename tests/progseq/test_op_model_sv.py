"""The operation model, generated end to end as a SystemVerilog package.

This is the component-tree projection: sub-component accessors, an `init`
lowered into the constructor, and the blocking `yield` contract. The flat model
in `examples/export/programming_seqs` covers the same backend from the other
direction, and both must keep working -- a change that fixes one and breaks the
other is not progress.

Assertions come in pairs wherever a defect had a plausible-looking output: the
absence checks (`has_not=`) are load-bearing, because an empty interface class
and a missing accessor both look like ordinary generated code.

The Verilator lint at the bottom is the cheapest strong signal available. It
does not prove the model is right; it proves the output is SystemVerilog, which
every structural assertion above quietly assumes.
