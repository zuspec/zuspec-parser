"""The shared op-model layer (P2.T1), proven equivalent before anything uses it.

`OpModel` replaces three per-backend walks. The only way to know it is a
replacement and not a fourth answer is to compare it, element for element,
against what each backend computes today -- which is what most of this file
does, and which is why it lands before the ports rather than with them.

One deliberate difference is recorded rather than reconciled: the SV and C
walks disagreed on SIBLING order, and `OpModel` picks SV's. See
`test_siblings_come_out_in_declaration_order`.

Since P2.T3-T5 the three backends CONSUME this layer, so the equivalence
assertions that justified it have become identity assertions -- `regular_nodes`
and `post_order` are now views onto the model. That is the intended end state
and the tests are kept in that form: they are what fails if a backend ever
grows a private walk again.
