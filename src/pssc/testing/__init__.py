"""Test helpers for people writing pssc target plugins.

Public and supported. Everything a plugin author needs to write their first
tests lives here, so they do not have to read pssc's own test tree and take a
dependency on its private fixtures -- which is what actually happens otherwise,
and which turns pssc's internal refactors into other people's broken builds.

    from pssc.testing import assert_common_tier, assert_deterministic

    def test_my_target_is_conforming():
        assert_common_tier("acme-c")
        assert_deterministic("acme-c", acme_c_style="terse")

WHAT THE BUNDLED MODEL COVERS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. `op_model_sources()`
returns a small self-contained PSS model shipped as package data: register
groups, a nested register array with an affine offset fold, packed value
structs, read-modify-write, a do-while poll, and a constructor taking an
`addr_handle_t`. That is enough to exercise the register model, the body
lowering and the export API.

It does NOT have a component tree, a channel, an enum or a declared import.
pssc's own suite covers those against the real WB DMA model, which is not
shipped: it is 176 KB of one specific device, kept in sync with an upstream
copy by a script, and putting it in every wheel would make a vendored artifact
part of the public surface. A plugin whose backend handles those should point
`compile_op_model(sources=...)` at a model of its own that does -- and if this
kit ought to bundle a richer one, that is a real request rather than something
to fake by shipping the device model.
