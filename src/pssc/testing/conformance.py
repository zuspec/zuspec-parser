"""What it means for an operation-model target to be correct, as a runnable suite.

`assert_common_tier` and `assert_deterministic` check properties of the TARGET.
This checks properties of its OUTPUT, and it is the part a plugin author cannot
easily write for themselves: each of these was a real defect in one of pssc's
own backends, found late, and none of them fails a build.

The five checks, and the failure each one is:

* **Every operation appears.** An export API with operations missing -- or with
  none at all -- is what every front-end defect in this generator's history
  looked like: the model translated, the file was written, the run exited 0,
  and the API was empty. Nobody reads a warning printed by a successful build.
* **Every register address matches the offset fold.** The one class of bug a
  golden snapshot can never catch: a wrong address frozen into a snapshot stays
  green forever. The addresses are recomputed from the model here and looked
  for in the output.
* **Nothing undeclared is emitted.** A call the backend does not recognise used
  to be rendered verbatim, naming a function the target language does not have.
  It exits 0 and surfaces much later as an unresolved symbol.
* **Regeneration is byte-stable.** Nondeterminism defeats every incremental
  build downstream and is almost always an unordered set or dict.
* **The path list is a compilation order.** The list a target returns is what a
  build system hands the compiler, in order. A target returning its files in
  creation order instead breaks only when something compiles them together.

`run()` returns a report rather than raising, so a caller can see every failure
at once instead of the first. `assert_conforms()` is the assertion form.
