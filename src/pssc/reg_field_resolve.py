"""Register field bit layout -- the single owner of the ``packed_s<>`` mapping.

PSS 3.1 §21.14.1 lets a register field be named by a *string literal*:
``regs.csr.write_field("ch_en", 1)``. The string is a reference to a declared
field, not data, and two different questions have to be answered about it:

* **which field does the name mean?** -- a name-binding question, answered by
  the front end. pssparser resolves it at link time against the receiver's
  ``reg_c<R, ACC, SZ>`` template argument, with a real source location, the way
  it resolves every other name in the language. By the time a name reaches this
  module it has already been proven to exist and to be scalar.
* **which bits is that field?** -- this module.

Layout is *declaration order, LSB-first* -- the opposite of SystemVerilog. That
is a target representation, not a language rule, which is why it lives here on
the compiler side rather than in the front end. It is also why there must be
exactly one implementation of it: a second one that got the direction wrong
would produce wrong register bits with no diagnostic anywhere.
``targets/c/lower_reg_model.py`` therefore calls :func:`field_layout` rather
than recomputing the running bit offset it used to keep for itself.

The lookups here still raise :class:`RegFieldError` on a name they cannot find,
but that is a backstop against a front end that let something through, not the
plan of record for how a user learns about a typo. ``reg_rmw`` reports it
rather than assuming it cannot happen.
