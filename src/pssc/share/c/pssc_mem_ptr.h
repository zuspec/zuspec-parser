/* pssc_mem_ptr.h -- the POINTER-DEREFERENCE memory seam.
 *
 * Was `pssc_mem_mmio.h`, which named a USE ("memory-mapped I/O") rather than a
 * MECHANISM. The mechanism is what varies: this seam forms a pointer from the
 * address and dereferences it, which is what makes it free and what makes it
 * unusable when the address space is wider than a pointer (see the assertion
 * below). `pssc_mem_mmio.h` remains as an including shim.
 *
 * When addr_handle_t is a real CPU address, the seam is just a `volatile`
 * load/store -- no user code, no function pointer, no call. As `static inline`
 * each primitive compiles to a single load/store instruction. There is no
 * import API to implement, so the generated <prefix>_create takes only the base.
 *
 * Caveat: the address space must be directly CPU-addressable, and there is no
 * hook for logging, backdoor, or a simulated bus -- use vtable/direct for that.
 *
 * ORDERING: each primitive ends (writes) or begins (reads) with
 * PSSC_MEM_BARRIER(), a no-op unless the platform defines it. `volatile` binds
 * the compiler and nothing else; see pssc_mem.h for what that does and does not
 * buy you.

/* THE ASSUMPTION THIS SEAM IS BUILT ON, checked rather than documented.
 *
 * `pssc_addr_t` is 64 bits because PSS `addr_handle_t` is, and this seam turns
 * one into a pointer. On a 32-bit target that cast TRUNCATES -- silently, with
 * no warning at any -W level, producing a driver that programs the low 4 GiB of
 * a device that is not there. This is the one place the width matters, so it is
 * the one place that says so.
 *
 * If you hit this: the address space is wider than the machine's pointers, and
 * the fix is a different link style (vtable or direct), whose primitives take
 * the address by value and never form a pointer from it.
