/* pssc_mem_reg.h -- the BARE-METAL register seam: a pointer in, a load or a
 * store out, and nothing else.
 *
 * The other seams take an ADDRESS (`pssc_addr_t`) plus a context, because they
 * exist to route an access somewhere that is not this program's memory -- a
 * sequencer, a mock, a logger. This one exists for the case where the device IS
 * memory, and it carries neither: the generated driver forms the effective
 * address by following its register-layout struct, and hands the result
 * straight to a `volatile` load or store.
 *
 *     write32(&s->regs->int_msk_a, 25);
 *     uint32_t v = read32(&s->regs->csr);
 *
 * WHY A POINTER RATHER THAN AN ADDRESS. With the layout struct doing the
 * arithmetic there is no address to pass -- `&s->regs->bank[3].csr` is already
 * a pointer, and converting it to an integer only to convert it back would be
 * two casts around a value that was never anything else. It also gets the
 * compiler to check the arithmetic: a mistyped member is an error here and a
 * silently wrong offset in a hand-folded constant.
 *
 * WHY NO CONTEXT ARGUMENT. There is nothing to put in it. A `(void)s;` that
 * every primitive ignores is a parameter the caller has to have something to
 * pass, and on this target the caller has nothing.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS. No hook for logging, backdoor access, or a simulated bus,
 * and no way to reach an address space wider than a pointer. Those are the
 * vtable seam's job and it still has it.
 *
 * ORDERING: each primitive ends (writes) or begins (reads) with
 * PSSC_MEM_BARRIER(), a no-op unless the platform defines it. `volatile` binds
 * the compiler and nothing else -- see pssc_mem.h for what that does and does
 * not buy you.
 *
 * CONST IS LOAD-BEARING. A READONLY register is emitted as a `const` member of
 * the layout struct, so `&s->regs->int_src_a` is a `const uint32_t *` and will
 * not convert to the `volatile void *` the writes take. Writing a read-only
 * register is a compile error, which is what the absent `_write` accessor used
 * to buy and the reason the reads take a `const volatile void *`.
