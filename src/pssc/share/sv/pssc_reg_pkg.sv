  // register value struct, named `<VALUE_STRUCT>_<field>` -- so a masked write
  // reads as `csr.write_field(WB_DMA_CH_CSR_ars, 1)` rather than as the pair of
  // magic numbers it folds to. The constants are also the only way a hand-
  // written testbench can name a register bit without re-deriving the layout.
  //
  // NOT an enum, and the reason is correctness rather than taste. An SV enum
  // with no explicit base type is `int` -- signed, 32 bits -- so a mask on bit
  // 31 would be negative and a 64-bit register's mask would not fit at all.
  // The two members also want different types: a mask is a sized vector, a
  // shift is an int, and one enum cannot be both.
  //
  // `mask` is 64 bits because that is the widest register `reg_c` supports; it
  // is narrowed to the register's own `data_t` at each point of use. The field
  // bits are held IN PLACE (already shifted), so `mask` alone is enough to test
  // or clear a field, and `shift` is only needed to align a value.
