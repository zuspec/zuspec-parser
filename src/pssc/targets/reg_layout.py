"""Where every register sits, with the address arithmetic already folded.

`progseq_model` answers one question at a time ("what is this instance's
offset?"). This is the walk that asks all of them: it descends a component's
register subtree and returns one :class:`RegAccessor` per reachable register,
carrying the constant byte offset from the component's base and one stride per
array index between the component and the register.

It was `c/lower_reg_model._collect_accessors`, and it is here because it is the
first thing a SECOND backend needs and the last thing it should write for
itself. Nothing in the walk is C: it reads the PSS tree and does arithmetic.
What is C -- the accessor's spelling, its value type, whether it is emitted as
an inline function or a macro -- stays in the C backend, which builds its own
`_Acc` from these.

An address is the one thing in a generated programming API that a golden
snapshot cannot check (see `conformance.py`): a wrong offset frozen into a
snapshot stays green forever. Two backends computing offsets two ways is
therefore the worst kind of duplication available here, and this is the answer
to it.

# --- the map, as a C struct would lay it out --------------------------------
#
# `collect_accessors` above answers "where is this register" one register at a
# time, with every offset folded to a constant. That is what a per-register
# accessor needs and it is why it exists.
#
# What follows answers a different question -- "what does this register group
# LOOK LIKE" -- and it exists because the folded constants are the wrong shape
# for an IP with a thousand registers. One `_addr` function per register is code
# proportional to the register map; a struct is DATA proportional to the
# register map and code proportional to the registers actually touched. The
# offsets stop being restated per accessor and get stated once, by the layout,
# with the compiler folding the arithmetic at each use.
#
# The gaps are the whole difficulty. A folded offset does not care what sits
# between two registers; a struct member's position is decided by everything
# declared before it, so an unmapped hole has to be declared or every later
# register silently moves. Hence `PAD` members and, in the C emitter, a
# `_Static_assert` per member: the layout is a claim about addresses, and a
# claim about addresses that nothing checks is the one defect a golden snapshot
# can never catch.
