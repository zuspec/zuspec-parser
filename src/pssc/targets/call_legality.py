"""What a call may lower to, per target and per context.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Every programming-sequence backend used to render an
unrecognized call by emitting it verbatim, producing output that named a
function the target language does not have. It exits 0, the dv-flow task goes
green, and the failure surfaces much later as an unresolved symbol -- if
anything ever elaborates the generated class at all. See
`docs/lowering-call-legality.md` §1.

THE SHAPE. Three tiers, because the targets genuinely differ in capability and a
flat per-target list has no contract to hold them together:

  Tier 0   what PSS DECLARES. Not a support list: it is what separates
           "core-library function with no lowering here" from "no such
           function" -- two different bugs, and a flat whitelist reports them
           identically.
  Tier 1   COMMON: what EVERY backend must render. A target may extend this;
           it may never shrink it. `test_call_legality.py` enforces that.
  Tier 2   per-target extensions, declared through `register_extension` --
           by a built-in here, or by a plugin from its own package.

The four outcomes below exist so each failure gets an actionable message rather
than one generic "unsupported call".
