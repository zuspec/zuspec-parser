"""Style policies: the naming and layout decisions a backend asks about.

A backend has two kinds of decision in it. What the generated code MEANS --
which registers exist, what address each sits at, what a masked write does --
is the model's, and no policy may touch it. What the generated code LOOKS LIKE
-- that an operation is called `wb_dma_start`, that the header is `wb_dma.h`,
that a type carries a `_t` suffix -- is a convention, and it is the one thing
organisations actually need to change.

Before this, those two were the same code. Changing `wb_dma_start` to
`WbDma_Start` meant forking the backend, which means a fork that stops tracking
upstream the day it is made. A policy is ~50-150 lines and tracks upstream
automatically, which is the whole point of the tier.

The base class here is language-agnostic and nearly empty on purpose: the C
policy is in `targets/c/style.py`, and an SV or C++ one would sit beside it.
What they share is the *discovery* protocol -- `name`, `target`, and the
`pssc.styles` entry-point group -- not the methods, because "how do you spell a
type name" has no cross-language answer.
