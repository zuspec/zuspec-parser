"""A PSS register tree as Python: value classes plus folded accessor methods.

Two things are emitted, and the split matches every other backend's:

* one **value class** per register value struct, carrying the bit layout the
  model declares and nothing else -- the pack/unpack arithmetic is inherited
  from `_RegValue`, emitted once per module;
* one **accessor set** per reachable register, as methods on the component
  class, with the address folded to a constant plus one term per array index.

The addresses come from `targets/reg_layout.py`, which is also where the C
backend gets them. That is not tidiness: an address is the one thing in a
generated programming API that no golden snapshot can check, so two backends
computing offsets two ways is the worst duplication available here.
