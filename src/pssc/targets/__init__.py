"""pssc code-generation targets.

Holds the :class:`~pssc.targets.base.Target` ABC and a small internal registry.
Built-in targets register themselves when this package is imported; third-party
targets are discovered from the ``pssc.targets`` entry-point group by
:func:`discover`.

THE TWO RULES DISCOVERY IS BUILT AROUND.

1. *A broken plugin must not break pssc.* An entry point that raises on import,
   returns the wrong kind of object, or declares an API version this pssc does
   not speak is recorded in :data:`_PLUGIN_ERRORS` and skipped. Every other
   plugin still loads and every built-in still works. The alternative --
   propagating the exception -- means one bad package on the system makes
   ``pssc targets`` unusable, which is a worse failure than a missing target.

2. *A plugin must not silently take a name that is already taken.* Shadowing
   ``op-model-c`` by accident produces generated code from a backend the user
   never asked for, and nothing in the output says so. :func:`register` raises
   on a name collision unless the caller names the target it is replacing via
   ``replaces=``, which makes the override deliberate and greppable.

Set ``PSSC_NO_PLUGINS=1`` to skip discovery entirely -- the bisect tool for
"is this pssc's bug or my plugin's".
