"""Rendering PSS comments into a generated target language.

Shared by the SystemVerilog and C progseq emitters, which produce a close
transcription of their PSS source and so want the prose in the same places.

The three differ only in house style: the SV output uses `//` for statements
and `/** */` for documentation; the C output is uniformly `/* */`, which is
what every other comment it emits already looks like; a `#` language (Python,
Make, shell) has one form for both. All are selected with ``style``.

See docs/pss-comment-propagation-plan.md for where the text comes from, and why
orphaned comments are not among it.
