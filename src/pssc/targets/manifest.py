"""The operation model as JSON: what was generated, without reading it.

`--emit-manifest FILE` writes this beside the generated code. It answers "what
operations and registers does this API have, and where does each register sit"
for a consumer that is not a compiler -- a build system deciding what to
rebuild, a test generator enumerating operations, a documentation pass, a
register-map cross-check against an RDL source, or a person.

WHY IT IS NOT DERIVED FROM THE OUTPUT. Every one of those consumers otherwise
parses generated C, and a parser for generated C is a second implementation of
the generator's naming rules that nobody updates. The manifest is written from
the `OpModel` -- the same object the emitters render -- so it cannot describe a
different API from the one that was emitted.

VERSIONED FROM DAY ONE. :data:`SCHEMA` is a name and an integer, both in the
document. A consumer that checks it gets a comprehensible failure when the
shape changes; one that does not at least has the version in the file it kept.
The rule for bumping it is in the constant's own comment.

Plan: P8.T2.
