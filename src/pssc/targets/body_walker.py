"""One walk of an operation body; each language renders what it finds.

The three progseq emitters (`c/`, `cpp/`, `sv/lower_progseq.py`) each carry a
`_BodyEmitter` with the same shape: a `stmts`/`stmt`/`_stmt_lines` cascade over
the same thirteen statement kinds, an `expr` cascade over the same expression
kinds, the same comment attachment, and -- in C and C++ -- a byte-for-byte copy
of the same write-only-local analysis. What actually differs between them is
the RENDERING: `{` versus `begin`, four spaces versus two, `/* */` versus `//`.

This module is the part that does not differ. It provides:

* **Dispatch.** `stmt`/`expr` map a node's class name to a hook named after it
  (`StmtAnnAssign` -> `stmt_ann_assign`, `ExprRefBottomUp` ->
  `expr_ref_bottom_up`). A subclass renders by defining hooks; the walk, the
  recursion and the "no lowering for this" error are here.
* **Comment attachment.** Every nesting level goes through `stmt`, so one site
  carries a body's prose into the generated file -- and a statement that lowers
  to no lines takes its comment with it.
* **The two scans.** `scan_write_only` and `scan_output_locals` read the PSS
  tree and answer questions about it. Neither has a target language in it, and
  the first exists twice today.

The scans are free functions rather than methods because that is what makes
them checkable independently of any emitter: `tests/progseq/test_body_walker.py`
runs them against what the C emitter computes for itself, on the real WB DMA
model, before either backend is asked to move (plan P7.T1).

    SystemVerilog accepts that silently, so nothing noticed until a C compiler
    did.

    The compiler is right to complain and the model is right to discard, so
    neither gets changed: an emitter states the discard (`(void)x;`). Not
    dropping the declaration and the assignment -- the CALL has effects (it
    takes the token), and an emitter that decides which of a model's statements
    are pointless is one that will eventually be wrong about it.
