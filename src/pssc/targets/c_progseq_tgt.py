"""``c-progseq`` target: generate a reusable C programming API from a PSS
component tree.

Transforms the subtree rooted at ``--root`` into a C header (+ optional ``.c``):
register value unions, baked inline register accessors, per-component export
functions, and a component struct + factory. The memory-access seam is selected
by ``--link-style`` (vtable / direct / mmio); the register accessors and every
operation body are emitted identically across the three styles.
