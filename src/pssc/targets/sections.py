"""Named, ordered sections of a generated file.

A backend assembles a file from a list of these, so an extension can insert,
replace or drop ONE part without reimplementing the other twelve. The list is
the whole layout: what a subclass reads from `header_sections()` is what comes
out, in that order.

Every operation here NAMES the section it acts on and raises when that name
does not exist. That is the point of the module rather than a detail of it: a
list of callables would let `insert_after(s, "includes", ...)` silently do
nothing after an upstream rename, and the customisation would disappear from
the output with nothing to say it had. An exception at generation time is the
only way that surfaces at all.
