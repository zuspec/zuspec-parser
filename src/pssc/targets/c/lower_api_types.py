"""Emit the data types a C programming API mentions: enums and plain structs.

The C analogue of ``targets/sv/lower_api_types.py``, and it deliberately reuses
that module's ``collect_api_types``: WHICH types an API mentions is a property
of the model, not of the output language, and two collectors would be two
answers to one question. Only the rendering is here.

Register *value* structs are emitted by ``lower_reg_model``; this covers the
other half -- the enums and structs that appear in operation signatures, in
local declarations, and as component attributes (``wb_dma_status_e``,
``wb_dma_ch_cfg_s``, ``wb_dma_desc_s``).

    into generated SV" -- and now into generated C). Implicit numbering would
    reproduce them today and silently renumber the day someone reorders the PSS
