"""The memory-access funnel: every memory-touching spelling the C target emits.

Before this existed, `pssc_r32` / `pssc_w32` / `pssc_bus(s)` were written out
at six sites in `lower_reg_model.py` and two more in `lower_progseq.py`. Nothing
was wrong with any of them individually -- they agreed, and the golden snapshots
kept them agreeing -- but "the C target's memory seam" was not a thing you could
point at, only a pattern you could grep for. That makes a style extension
(phase 5b) impossible to write correctly: it would have to find all eight.

So: one object, and `test_package_layout.py::test_bus_spelling_has_one_home`
keeps it one. A subclass that changes `read`/`write` changes every memory access
the target emits, including the ones inside baked accessors, because there is
nowhere else for them to come from.

Named for the ABSTRACTION, not the transport. This funnel carries more than
memory-mapped I/O -- `_mem_call` lowers the `write32` calls that write a DMA
descriptor into system RAM -- and `mem` is already the word this codebase uses
for the abstraction (`pssc::mem_if`, `pssc_mem*.h`, `--mem-access`). `bus_expr`
keeps `bus` because it renders the HANDLE (`pssc_bus(s)`), which is the one
thing here that really is a bus.
