"""The C backend's style policy: every naming and layout decision it makes.

`CStylePolicy` is the default and reproduces today's output character for
character -- `test_style_policy.py::test_default_policy_is_identity` and the
golden snapshots both hold it to that. A house style subclasses it and
overrides the two or three methods it cares about.

What is HERE is spelling. What is not here, and never will be, is the address a
register sits at, which registers exist, or what a masked write does; those
come off the `OpModel` and are the model's statements about the device. The
split is not a matter of taste -- a policy that could move an address would be
a supported way to generate firmware that talks to the wrong offsets.
