"""Lower a PSS register tree to C: value unions + baked inline accessors.

Emits, for the register subtree reachable from a root component:
  * one C11 anonymous-union value type per register value struct (fields in
    declaration order -- LSB-first, the opposite of SV; little-endian assumed);
  * a baked ``static inline`` accessor trio (``_addr``/``_read``/``_write``) per
    register, with the address arithmetic folded to gen-time constants (only the
    component ``base`` and any array indices are runtime). Every memory access
    in them is rendered by the funnel in ``mem_access.py`` -- this module owns
    the addresses, not the spelling of the access -- and they are emitted
    identically across all link styles; only ``pssc_bus`` (defined in
    lower_progseq) varies.
