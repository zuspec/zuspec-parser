"""Lower a PSS component TREE to the C programming API: one handle struct per
component (+ the pssc_bus shim), export-function declarations, the
lifecycle/`init`, and the operation bodies.

Bodies translate the PSS procedural subset 1:1. Unlike the SV backend, C keeps
native value-returning register reads, native ``return`` values, and native
``do...while`` (PSS ``repeat{}while``) -- so the three SV-only rewrites do not
fire here; the body is closer to the PSS source.

THE TREE, not just the root. Every regular component reachable from the root
gets its own struct, its own symbol prefix taken from its TYPE name, its own
register accessors and its own operations; a parent embeds its children BY
VALUE, so one caller-provided object covers the whole tree and there is nothing
to allocate at any level. This file emitted the root alone until C1, which is
why a model like WB DMA -- whose entire per-channel operation surface lives on a
sub-component -- generated a header that compiled cleanly and contained none of
the operations anybody wanted.
