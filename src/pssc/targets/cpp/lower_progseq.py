"""Lower a PSS component TREE to the C++ programming API.

Each regular component becomes a pure-virtual export interface (``<Cls>_if``)
and a class implementing it; the model's `import target/solve function`s become
one ``<ns>_import_if``, which extends ``pssc::mem_if`` so the platform supplies
memory access and its own hooks through a single object.

WHERE THIS DIFFERS FROM THE C BACKEND, AND WHY. C has no member functions, so
its backend bakes a free accessor per register and threads an explicit handle
through every call. C++ has the register model as objects already
(``pssc::reg<T, ACC>``, 1:1 with SystemVerilog's ``reg_c #(T, ACC)``), so a PSS
register access lowers to the SAME PATH SPELLED THE SAME WAY --
``this->regs.channels[ch].CSR.write(v)`` -- and needs no per-register
generation at all. Sub-components are members rather than an inlined struct
tree, operations are methods rather than functions taking `s`, and channels are
typed (``pssc::chan1<bool>``) rather than widened to a 64-bit payload.

CONSTRUCTION IS TWO-PHASE, and it has to be. A PSS constructor binds a register
group at a handle it computes (`regs.set_handle(h)`), and a parent computes its
CHILDREN's handles in its own constructor body -- which runs after the children,
as members, already exist. So a component is constructed with the seam alone and
`initialize(...)` runs the PSS constructor body, rebinding register groups as it
goes. `create()` does both for the root, which is what a caller normally wants.
See ``pssc::reg``'s note on why it holds a pointer rather than a reference.

    is by definition whatever this model declared. Extending the seam rather
    than adding a second parameter means the platform implements one class and
    a generated body reaches everything it needs through one reference.

    Every DECLARED import gets a pure virtual, not only every called one: the

    too many pays nothing while one discovering a requirement later pays a
    rebuild. Same position as the C backend's prototypes and the SV

    `is_solve` vs `is_target` does not survive, and correctly: the distinction
    is about when a function runs relative to solving, and this target has no
    solver (HAVE_RUNTIME_SOLVER=false).

    A MODEL WITH NO IMPORTS GETS AN ALIAS, not an empty struct that derives from
    `pssc::mem_if`. The name is what every generated signature says, so it has
    to exist either way -- but an empty derived class would mean an existing
    `mem_if` implementation (including the shipped `pssc::mmio_mem`) could not
    be passed without being re-wrapped, to gain nothing. The alias says the true
    thing: for this model, what the platform must supply IS memory access.

    `--yield import` ADDS `yield_()` here, because that mode lowers a PSS
    `yield` to a call on the platform -- and everything the generated code
    calls of the platform has to be declared where the platform can see it. The
