"""What a backend PUBLISHES as overridable, and what that promises.

Every public method of a class is overridable in Python. That is the problem
this module solves rather than the feature it provides: without a marked set,
"the override surface" is whatever an extension author happened to reach for,
pssc cannot change any of it without breaking someone, and nobody can tell
which methods were designed to be wrapped from which merely happen to be
callable.

`@overridable` marks the ones that were designed for it and states what the
promise is:

  * **stable** -- the signature and the meaning will not change without a
    deprecation window. Override it freely.
  * **provisional** -- published for a real extension to use, and expected to
    move. Override it, and read the release notes.

`docs/override-surface.json` is the checked-in manifest of the marked set, and
`tests/unit/test_override_surface.py` fails when code and manifest disagree.
That is the whole mechanism: growing the surface takes a diff in two files, so
it is a decision somebody makes rather than a thing that happens (design I14).

`pairs_with` records the other half of a method that cannot be overridden
alone -- see :func:`check_pairs`.

Design: docs/generator-style-extensions-design.md §2.6.2, §6.
