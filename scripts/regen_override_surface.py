"""Rewrite docs/override-surface.json from the `@overridable` marks.

The manifest is checked in so that growing pssc's published override surface is
a diff in TWO files -- the mark and the manifest -- rather than a thing that
happens when somebody adds a decorator. `tests/unit/test_override_surface.py`
fails when the two disagree.

Running this is legitimate when the marks changed ON PURPOSE, and the diff it
produces belongs in the same commit and the same review as that change. The
admission rule for a NEW entry is in docs/extension-stability.md: a method
becomes overridable because a real extension needed it, not because it looked
useful.

    python scripts/regen_override_surface.py            # rewrite
    python scripts/regen_override_surface.py --check    # exit 1 if stale
