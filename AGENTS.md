# Codex
You must prefix all commands with 'direnv exec . <command>' to get
a proper environment. (If direnv is not approved, the vendored venv at
`packages/python/` can be used directly with `PYTHONPATH=./src`.)

# Package

This is **pssc** (the PSS compiler), import root `pssc`, source under `src/pssc/`.
It was previously `zuspec-fe-pss` (import root `zuspec.fe.pss`); see
`docs/migration-from-zuspec-fe-pss.md` for the import map.

# Build and run

Focus on Python and unit tests for now.

```
direnv exec . pytest tests/unit          # fast unit suite (pytest.ini default)
direnv exec . pssc --version             # console entry point
```

If `pytest` on PATH cannot import `pssc` (this checkout's `packages.envrc` does
not export PYTHONPATH), use the vendored venv, which has pssc installed
editable along with zuspec and pssparser:

```
direnv exec . ../python/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit
```

## Golden snapshots

`tests/progseq/golden/` holds byte-exact snapshots of the operation-model
backends' output for the configurations in `tests/progseq/golden_util.py`. They
are what makes "this refactor preserves output" a checked claim rather than an
assertion (see `docs/generator-style-extensions-plan.md`).

```
direnv exec . ../python/bin/python -m pytest tests/progseq -k golden
PSSC_GOLDEN_REGEN=1 ../python/bin/python scripts/regen_golden.py [config...]
```

Regenerating is legitimate **only** alongside an intentional change to
generated output, in the same commit, with the snapshot diff reviewed as part
of that change. It is never the way to make a failing test pass during a
refactor that was supposed to preserve output — that is the one failure this
mechanism exists to catch. The `PSSC_GOLDEN_REGEN=1` guard is there to make the
act deliberate.

Snapshots prove *sameness*, not correctness: a wrong address frozen into a
golden file stays green forever. Changes touching address computation or
register access must also run the behavioural tests
(`test_op_model_behaviour_c.py`, `test_build_wb_dma_c.py`).

## The C memory seam

`pssc_r32` / `pssc_w32` / `pssc_bus(s)` are emitted from exactly one place,
`targets/c/mem_access.py` (`MemAccess`), and
`test_package_layout.py::test_bus_spelling_has_one_home` keeps it that way. If
you need a memory access in the C backend, call the funnel rather than writing
the primitive out — that test will fail otherwise. It also owns the accessor
name scheme (`<base>_read_val`, `<base>_write_masked`, …), which
`lower_reg_model` uses to DEFINE the accessors and `lower_progseq` to CALL
them; those were two hand-kept tables before.

## The C backend is a class

`targets/c/backend.py` (`COpModelBackend`) assembles the generated files;
`c_progseq_gen.generate()` only turns command-line keywords into a `CSettings`.
Two rules hold it together, and both are tested
(`tests/progseq/test_c_backend_class.py`):

* **Every `emit_*` returns text; only `generate`/`write_files` touch disk.**
  A method that writes cannot be wrapped by a subclass calling `super()`, which
  is the whole point of the class.
* **The header is exactly its `header_sections()`**, in order, each section
  carrying its own trailing blank. Use `targets/sections.py`
  (`insert_after`/`replace`/…) to change one — those raise on a name that does
  not exist, so an upstream rename surfaces instead of silently dropping a
  customisation.

Which `solve function` is the constructor comes from `model.ctor_names`, never
from `progseq_model.current_ctor_names()`. The ambient value remains only for
callers outside a compile; no emitter reads it, and
`test_ctor_name.py::test_generation_does_not_read_the_ambient_ctor_names` fails
if one starts.

## One body walk, three renderings

`targets/body_walker.py` owns the walk over an operation body; the C and SV
`_BodyEmitter`s render what it finds. A node kind is handled by a hook **named
after it** — `StmtForeach` → `stmt_foreach`, `ExprRefBottomUp` →
`expr_ref_bottom_up` — so there is no cascade to read past and no table to keep
in step with the IR. A missing hook names itself in the error.

Comment attachment happens in `BodyWalker.stmt` alone, so every nesting level
of every ported language carries its PSS prose. A statement that lowers to no
lines takes its comment with it.

The two scans are free functions, not methods: `scan_write_only` (locals the
model assigns and never reads — emitted as `(void)x;`) and
`scan_output_locals` (the local a channel `try_get` writes through, widened to
`uint64_t`). C++ still carries its own copy of the first one; it is unported.

In C a CALL is dispatched on its `Disposition` from `call_legality.py` — the
same table `validate_calls.py` gates on — via `CallDispatch`. Add a hook when
you add an entry: `test_dispatch_matches_registry` fails otherwise. SV keeps
its own `expr_call`, deliberately: its chain ends in a generic call rendering
that is correct for everything, so there is nothing for a table to decide.

`body_walker.py` is NOT part of the published override surface. `body_emitter_cls`
is marked `provisional` for exactly this kind of change.

## Where a register lives

`targets/reg_layout.py` (`collect_accessors`) is the ONE walk that says which
registers exist and at what offset: a constant from the component's base, plus
one stride per array index crossed. C's `lower_reg_model` builds its `_Acc` from
it, the Python backend builds its methods from it, and `--emit-manifest`
reports it.

One walk because an address is the one thing in a generated API a golden
snapshot can never check — a wrong offset frozen into a snapshot stays green
forever. Two backends folding offsets two ways is the worst duplication
available here. If you need something the walk does not carry, add it to
`RegAccessor`; do not re-walk.

## The Python backend

`op-model-py` (`targets/py/`, `targets/py_progseq_tgt.py`) generates ONE module:
component classes, folded register accessor methods, value classes with a bit
layout, and the operations. `src/pssc/share/py/pssc_rt.py` is the runtime it
copies out — a documented `Bus` protocol, a `MemoryBus` to bring a model up on,
and a depth-1 `Chan1`.

Two properties are load-bearing and both are tested:

* **The generated module imports nothing** unless the model has channels. A
  generated driver gets copied onto a lab machine; one file with no
  dependencies still runs there. The bus is duck-typed, and the two base
  classes (`_RegValue`, `_Struct`) are emitted into the module.
* **It is imported and DRIVEN by its tests**, not grepped. That is the only
  place in this repo where "is the address right" and "does the completion poll
  terminate" are asked of a running generated model without a compiler or a
  simulator — so an offset bug fails there first, in three languages' worth of
  shared code.

Its `PyOpModelBackend` follows `COpModelBackend`'s two rules (every `emit_*`
returns text; the module is exactly its `module_sections()`) but carries no
`@overridable` marks and is NOT a published surface. Publishing one is a
manifest edit when an extension actually needs it.

## The manifest

`--emit-manifest FILE` writes the elaborated model as JSON
(`targets/manifest.py`): components, operations with signatures, register
offsets and strides, value-struct bit layouts, and the produced files with
`generated` / `runtime` roles. It exists so a consumer never parses generated
code — a parser for generated C is a second copy of the naming rules that
nobody updates.

It is written from the `OpModel` the emitters render and AFTER `emit`, so it
cannot describe an API that was not produced. A target declares its
ABI-affecting options through `abi_settings()`; `{}` is a legitimate answer.
Bump `manifest.VERSION` only when a reader of the old shape would be WRONG —
adding a field is not a bump.

## The published override surface

A method of `COpModelBackend` that a mid-weight extension may subclass carries
`@overridable(since=..., stability=...)`, and the marked set is checked in at
`docs/override-surface.json`. Adding a mark alone fails
`test_override_surface.py::test_manifest_matches_code` — growing the surface
takes a second, human-written edit, which is the whole point: every public
method is overridable in Python, and without a marked set "the API" is whatever
somebody reached for.

```
direnv exec . pssc targets --overrides op-model-c   # what may be overridden
python scripts/regen_override_surface.py            # after an intended change
```

`stable` promises the signature and meaning; `provisional` says "published for
a real extension, expected to move". A marked method's docstring must state
its contract — a test enforces that too. `pairs_with` names a member that
cannot be overridden alone (the include guard's two halves; the API types and
the register value unions, which partition one set of declarations); taking one
half is refused at target REGISTRATION, before any model is read.

`derives_from = "op-model-c"` gives a target its ancestor's call legality, CLI
options, `target_cfg` and styles — each wired separately, because one
integration test would let two of the four silently not work.
`tests/plugins/pssc_fixture_plugin/backend.py` is the worked example: 84 lines
for an inserted section, a wrapped `emit_operation`, an extra file and a house
style. If a change of that size cannot be written short, the surface is wrong.

Extensions do not get a golden snapshot — upstream moves. Their checkable claim
is differential:

```python
assert_differs_from_baseline("op-model-acme-c", "op-model-c",
                             expect_changed=["acme_compliance", "impl"])
```

It fails on an undeclared difference AND on a declared one that did not happen;
the second half is what catches an override that silently stopped taking effect.

## Styles

`--style NAME` selects a `CStylePolicy` (`targets/c/style.py`) for the C
op-model backend, resolved from the `pssc.styles` entry-point group keyed
`"<target>:<style>"`. The default policy reproduces today's output exactly, so
every naming/layout decision in the C backend goes through it rather than being
hard-coded — add new ones there, not inline.

A policy decides SPELLING. It cannot decide an address, which registers exist,
the access-direction rules, or the read inside a masked write; those are the
model's, and `mem_access.py` raises `LegalityError` rather than asking a policy
for an access the register does not have. `tests/plugins/pssc_fixture_plugin`
ships a 43-line `AcmeStyle` that mandates house register macros — the worked
example.

## Target plugins

Third-party targets are discovered from the `pssc.targets` entry-point group.
`tests/plugins/pssc_fixture_plugin/` is a minimal real one, used by
`tests/unit/test_plugin_integration.py` (marker: `plugin`), which builds and
installs it into a temp prefix — never into your environment. It is skipped if
no installer (`pip`, or `build` + `setuptools`) is available.

`PSSC_NO_PLUGINS=1` skips discovery entirely. That is the first thing to try
when pssc misbehaves on a machine with plugins installed: it separates "pssc's
bug" from "a plugin's bug" in one command.

`pssc.testing` is the **public** kit for people writing targets — a bundled PSS
model, `compile_op_model`, `assert_common_tier`, `assert_deterministic`,
`golden_dir_compare`, and `pssc.testing.conformance.run()`. Use it in pssc's own
tests too where it fits: anything that only works via a private fixture is
something a plugin author cannot do.

```
direnv exec . ../python/bin/python -m pytest tests/progseq/test_conformance.py
```

The bundled model is a byte copy of `examples/export/programming_seqs/`
(setuptools cannot package files outside the package dir). If you edit one,
edit both — `test_the_bundled_model_matches_the_example_it_came_from` fails
otherwise. The real WB DMA model is deliberately not shipped.

The `c-host` target's compile-time constraint solving needs the **dv-solve** C
library built once:

```
cmake -S packages/dv-solve -B packages/dv-solve/build
cmake --build packages/dv-solve/build --target dv_solve
```

(Without it, rand fields fall back to zero-initialization.)

Do not make assumptions about the number of cores. Use what is available.

## Documentation that is checked

`docs/custom-generator-styles.md` is the user-facing extension guide (four
levels: style, backend override, new emitter, new language). Its code blocks are
**quoted verbatim** from files the test suite runs — mostly
`tests/plugins/pssc_fixture_plugin/` and `src/pssc/targets/py*` — and each block
names its source in a leading `#` comment.
`tests/unit/test_doc_examples.py` fails if a block and its source drift apart,
if a quoted file moves, if a `--flag` shown in a shell example is not a real
option, or if a link between doc pages dangles. So: **fix the doc, not the
source** — the source is what runs, and the guide is what the reader believes.

Two references hang off it and are checked the same way:
`docs/extension-stability.md` (what `stable`/`provisional` promise, the
admission rule for a new `@overridable`, and the deprecation window) and
`docs/op-model-manifest.md` (the `--emit-manifest` schema). If you change what a
surface promises, that page is the one to edit — nothing else states the policy.

## Changing the AST
Schema for the AST is in `ast`. It is processed by `packages/pyastbuilder`.
This schema defines the data model created by parsing PSS code.
Any time an AST file is changed, the environment must be built from
scratch by removing the build directory and re-running cmake+make.
(The pssc migration itself touches only Python — no AST/cmake rebuild needed.)
